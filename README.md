Final notes:

This should meet the basic requirement of the project. It is not perfect. 
Some functions were intentionally left out to save time for more learning.
For validation, it used both html and JS validation. It was kind of inconsistent,
but had chances to learn both. It can be improved if this is a real online sign-in.
For error message handling, it didn't use what was suggested, red border. It uses a
red color message for each field. 

A lot more to do to make it better, but it's time to move on for new topic for now.
